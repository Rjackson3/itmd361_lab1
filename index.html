  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Ryan jackson and I am a junior at Devry University Advantage Academy. MY major is in IT and I picked it because I find myself very comfortable working with computeres. I am a jehovah's witness and I like to watch anime and youtube a lot as well as workout and listen to and make music. I look forward to working with all of you.</p>
